 * The metadata of a file starts with the compileflags stored in a single byte. It is followed by a byte indicating the major and another byte indicating the minor version of cellox that was used to create the chunk.
 * Each chunk is stored in three different segments:
 * <ol>
 * <li>----constants-----</li>
 * <li>----inner chunks--</li>
 * <li>----bytecode------</li>
 * </ol>
The inner chunks segment contains all the functions that were declared in the parent chunk.
 * @param chunk The chunk that is stored
 * @param programmPath The program path of the cellox program
 * @param flags Compile flags used to compile the sourcecode to a cellox chunk file
 * @return 0 -> OK, -1 -> Error
